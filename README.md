# In-Hut-Development Series
-----------------------------

This repository contains all the examples of In-Hut-Development projects which are available on our YouTube Channel.

This series contains detailed explanation of Projects which we created in various technologies. We briefly talked about how you can create simple yet powerful projects with help of various technologies. We also covered what are the best industry standards/practices while creating any enterprise applications.

For each Project creation I briefly covered below aspects

	1. What is this project about?
	2. Prerequisites
	3. Project Requirements
	4. Project Demo

If you have any questions, queries or suggestions related to any of the project, please drop it in video comments section, we will try to give our feedback as early as possible.
